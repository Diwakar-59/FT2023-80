Description :-

Teams – Contains the names of all the participating teams along with their captain names.
Fixtures – Contains the match fixing details along with the details regarding the venues and date of
           match.
match_result – Contains the outcomes of the matches.

Reason :- The teams fixtures table holds the fixtures which are pre-decided and has a primary key
match_id. The primary key, match_id acts as a foreign key for the table match_result and we can get
the result of a particular match and other details regarding the match using the match id.


Example Query : select match_won_ by, Captain from match_result inner join Teams on
match_result.match_won_by = Teams.Name;

The above query provides us with the name of the team who won along with its captain name by
joining the two tables, match_result and Teams.
